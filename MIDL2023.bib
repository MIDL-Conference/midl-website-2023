    abstract = "Interpreting deep learning models typically relies on post-hoc saliency map techniques. However, these techniques often fail to serve as actionable feedback to clinicians, and they do not directly explain the decision mechanism. Here, we propose an inherently interpretable model that combines the feature extraction capabilities of deep neural networks with advantages of sparse linear models in interpretability. Our approach relies on straightforward but effective changes to a deep bag-of-local-features model (BagNet). These modifications lead to fine-grained and sparse class evidence maps which, by design, correctly reflect the model\'s decision mechanism. Our model is particularly suited for tasks which rely on characterising regions of interests that are very small and distributed over the image. In this paper, we focus on the detection of Diabetic Retinopathy, which is characterised by the progressive presence of small retinal lesions on fundus images. We observed good classification accuracy despite our added sparseness constraint. In addition, our model precisely highlighted retinal lesions relevant for the disease grading task and excluded irrelevant regions from the decision mechanism. The results suggest our sparse BagNet model can be a useful tool for clinicians as it allows efficient inspection of the model predictions and facilitates clinicians\' and patients\' trust."

    abstract = "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) to help diagnose the disease from digital pathology images has the potential to greatly improve patient outcomes. However, current methods for detecting, segmenting, and sub-typing breast neoplasms and other proliferative lesions often rely on costly and time-consuming manual annotation efforts, which can be impractical for large-scale datasets. In this work, we propose an annotation-free learning framework to jointly detect, segment, and subtype breast neoplasms. Our approach leverages top-k multiple instance learning to train an initial neoplasm detection backbone network from weakly-labeled whole slide images, which is then used to automatically generate pixel-level pseudo-labels for whole slides with only one subtype. A second network is trained using these pseudo-labels, and slide-level classification is performed by training an aggregator network that fuses the embeddings from both backbone networks. We trained and validated our framework on large-scale datasets with more than 100k whole slide images and demonstrate its effectiveness on tasks including breast neoplasms detection, segmentation, and subtyping."

In the clinical workflow, such methods have the potential to assist in screening and pre-filtering exams for potential pathologies and thus meaningfully support radiologists. Even though much work has been done on using auto-encoders (AE) for anomaly detection, there are still two critical challenges to overcome: First, learning compact and detailed representations of the healthy distribution is cumbersome. Recent work shows that AEs can reconstruct some types of anomalies even better than actual samples from the training distribution. Second, while the majority of unsupervised algorithms are tailored to detect hyperintense lesions on FLAIR brain MR scans, recent improvements in basic intensity thresholding techniques have outperformed them.  Moreover, we found that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) AEs fail to detect several classes of non-hyperintense anomalies on T1w brain MRIs, such as brain atrophy, edema, or resections. In this work, we propose reversed AEs (RA) to generate pseudo-healthy reconstructions and localize various brain pathologies. We extensively evaluate our method on T1w brain scans and increase the detection of global pathology and artefacts from 73.1 to 89.4 AUROC and the amount of detected local pathologies from 52.6\% to 86.0\% compared to SOTA methods."

We explore several candidate methods to improve low-data performance, including: (i) adapting generic pre-trained models to novel image and text domains (i.e.\ medical imaging and reports) via unimodal self-supervision; (ii) using local (e.g.\ GLoRIA) \\& global (e.g. InfoNCE) contrastive loss functions as well as a combination of the two; (iii) extra supervision during VLM training, via: (a) image- and text-only self-supervision, and (b) creating additional positive image-text pairs for training through augmentation and nearest-neighbour search.  Using text-to-image retrieval as a benchmark, we evaluate the performance of these methods with variable sized training datasets of paired chest X-rays and radiological reports.  Combined, they significantly improve retrieval compared to fine-tuning CLIP, roughly equivalent to training with $10\times$ the data. A similar pattern is found in the downstream task classification of CXR-related conditions with our method outperforming CLIP and also BioVIL, a strong CXR VLM benchmark, in the zero-shot and linear probing settings. We conclude with a set of recommendations for researchers aiming to train vision-language models on other medical imaging modalities when training data is scarce.

However, to detect different types of stains in a given mIHC image is a challenging problem, especially when the number of stains is high. Previous deep-learning-based methods mostly assume full supervision; yet the annotation can be costly. In this paper, we propose a novel unsupervised stain decomposition method to detect different stains simultaneously. Our method does not require any supervision, except for color samples of different stains. A main technical challenge is that the problem is underdetermined and can have multiple solutions. To conquer this issue, we propose a novel inversion regulation technique, which eliminates most undesirable solutions. On a 7-plexed IHC image dataset, the proposed method achieves high quality stain decomposition results without human annotation."

A potential remedy to this issue lies in the fact that often multiple sequences are acquired on different planes. However, in practice, these sequences are not orthogonal to each other, limiting the applicability of many previous solutions to reconstruct higher-resolution images from multiple lower-resolution ones. We propose a novel deep learning-based solution to generating high-resolution masks from multiple low-resolution images. Our method combines segmentation and unsupervised registration networks by introducing two new regularizations to make registration and segmentation reinforce each other. Finally, we introduce a multi-view fusion method to generate high-resolution target object masks. The experimental results on two datasets show the superiority of our methods. Importantly, the advantage of not using high-resolution images in the training process makes our method applicable to a wide variety of MRI segmentation tasks."

First, we apply a sinusoidal transformation to the harmonic phase input, which enables end-to-end training and avoids the need for phase interpolation. Second, we propose a Jacobian determinant-based learning objective to encourage incompressible flow fields for deforming biological tissues.  Our method efficiently estimates 3D motion fields that are accurate, dense, and approximately diffeomorphic and incompressible. The efficacy of the method is assessed using human tongue motion during speech, and includes both healthy controls and patients that have undergone glossectomy.

More and more Artificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms are developed to help pathologists perform and standardize their diagnosis. However, those models can render their prediction without consideration of the ambiguity of the classes and can fail without notice which prevent their wider acceptance in a clinical context.  In this paper, we propose a new score to measure the confidence of AI models in grading tasks. Our confidence score is specifically adapted to ordinal output variables, is versatile and does not require extra training or additional inferences nor particular architecture changes.  Comparison to other popular techniques such as Monte Carlo Dropout and deep ensembles shows that our method provides state-of-the art results, while being simpler, more versatile and less computationally intensive.  The score is also easily interpretable and consistent with real life hesitations of pathologists. We show that the score is capable of accurately identifying mispredicted slides and that accuracy for high confidence decisions is significantly higher than for low-confidence decisions (gap in AUC of 17.1\\% on the test set).  We believe that the proposed confidence score could be leveraged by pathologists directly in their workflow and assist them on difficult tasks such as grading precancerous lesions."

However, these methods often cause blurring in atrophied regions, and cannot simulate realistic atrophy within deep sulci where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is obscured or absent. In this paper, we present a solution using a self-supervised inpainting model to generate CSF in these regions and create images with more plausible GM/CSF boundaries. Specifically, we introduce a novel, 3D GAN model that incorporates patch-based dropout training, edge map priors, and sinusoidal positional encoding, all of which are established methods previously limited to 2D domains. We show that our framework significantly improves the quality of the resulting synthetic images and is adaptable to unseen data with fine-tuning.

Using the popular energy-based OOD detection framework, we find that the optimal protocol is to synthesize latent-space inliers along with diverse pixel-space outliers.

Here, we investigate two additional risk factors, tumor budding and lymphocyte infiltration at the invasive front, which are known to be clinically relevant. We capture the spatial layout of tumor buds and T-cells and use graph-based deep learning to investigate them as potential risk predictors. Our pT1 Hotspot Tumor Budding T-cell Graph (pT1-HBTG) dataset consists of 626 tumor budding hotspots from 575 patients. We propose and compare three different graph structures, as well as combinations of the node labels. The best-performing Graph Neural Network architecture is able to increase specificity by 20\% compared to the currently recommended risk stratification based on histopathological risk factors, without losing any sensitivity.

As each dMRI voxel is typically a mixture of various overlapping structures, there is a need for blind deconvolution to recover crossing anatomical structures such as white matter tracts. Existing dMRI work takes either an iterative or deep learning approach to sparse spherical deconvolution, yet it typically does not account for relationships between neighboring measurements. This work constructs equivariant deep learning layers which respect to symmetries of spatial rotations, reflections, and translations, alongside the symmetries of voxelwise spherical rotations. As a result, RT-ESD improves on previous work across several tasks including fiber recovery on the DiSCo dataset, deconvolution-derived partial volume estimation on real-world in vivo human brain dMRI, and improved downstream reconstruction of fiber tractograms on the Tractometer dataset.

The classical approach for longitudinal comparison involves normalizing for nuisance variations, such as image orientation or contrast differences, via pre-processing. Statistical analysis is, in turn, conducted to detect changes of interest, either at the individual or population level. This classical approach can suffer from pre-processing issues and limitations of the statistical modeling. For example, normalizing for nuisance variation might be hard in settings where there are a lot of idiosyncratic changes. In this paper, we present a simple machine learning-based approach that can alleviate these issues. In our approach, we train a deep learning model (called PaIRNet, for Pairwise Image Ranking Network) to compare pairs of longitudinal images, with or without supervision. In the self-supervised setup, for instance, the model is trained to temporally order the images, which requires learning to recognize time-irreversible changes. Our results from four datasets demonstrate that PaIRNet can be very effective in localizing and quantifying meaningful longitudinal changes while discounting nuisance variation.

In-silico clinical trials of medical devices, for instance, require the development of virtual populations of anatomy that capture enough variability while remaining plausible. Model construction and use are heavily influenced by the correspondence problem and establishing shape matching over a large number of training data.This study focuses on generating virtual cohorts of left ventricle geometries resembling different-sized shape populations, suitable for in-silico experiments. We present an unsupervised data-driven probabilistic generative model for shapes. This framework incorporates an attention-based shape matching procedure using graph neural networks, coupled with a $\beta-$VAE generation model, eliminating the need for initial shape correspondence. Left ventricle shapes derived from cardiac magnetic resonance images available in the UK Biobank are utilized for training and validating the framework. We investigate our method’s generative capabilities in terms of generalisation and specificity and show that it is able to synthesise virtual populations of realistic shapes with volumetric measurements in line with actual clinical indices. Moreover, results show our method outperforms joint registration-PCA-based models."

To address this challenge, in this study, we systematically assess the effect of various augmentations on the quality and robustness of the learned representations. We train and evaluate Siamese Networks for abnormality detection on chest X-Rays across three large datasets (MIMIC-CXR, CheXpert and VinDr-CXR). We investigate the efficacy of the learned representations through experiments involving linear probing, fine-tuning, zero-shot transfer, and data efficiency. Finally, we identify a set of augmentations that yield robust representations that generalize well to both out-of-distribution data and diseases, while outperforming supervised baselines using just zero-shot transfer and linear probes by up to 20\%."

    abstract = "Smoothing hard-label assignments has emerged as a popular strategy in training discriminative models. Nevertheless, most existing approaches are typically designed for classification tasks, ignoring underlying properties of dense prediction problems, such as medical image segmentation. First, these strategies often ignore the spatial relations between a given pixel and its neighbours. And second, the image context associated with each label is overlooked, which can convey important information about potential errors or ambiguities in the segmentation masks. To address these limitations, we propose in this work geodesic label smoothing (GeoLS), which integrates image information into the label smoothing process by leveraging the geodesic distance transform of the images. As the resulting label assignment is based on the computed geodesic map, class-wise relationships in the soft-labels are better modeled, as it considers image gradients at the boundary of two or more categories. Furthermore, spatial pixel-wise relationships are captured in the geodesic distance transform, integrating richer information than resorting to the Euclidean distance between pixels. We evaluate our method on two publicly available segmentation benchmarks and compare them to popular segmentation loss functions that directly modify the standard hard-label assignments. The proposed geodesic label smoothing improves the segmentation accuracy over existing soft-labeling strategies, demonstrating the validity of integrating image information into the label smoothing process.

This paper seeks to address the cold start problem and develops a novel active querying strategy, named HaCon, that can exploit the three advantages of contrastive learning: (1) no annotation is required; (2) label diversity is ensured by pseudo-labels to mitigate bias; (3) typical data is determined by contrastive features to reduce outliers. Experiments on three public medical datasets show that HaCon not only significantly outperforms existing active querying strategies but also surpasses random selection by a large margin.

Each subject was scanned in two MR scanners of different magnetic field strengths (1.5 T and 3 T), resulting in a paired data set that shows scanner-inherent differences. We map images from the source contrast to the target contrast for both directions, from 3 T to 1.5 T and from 1.5 T to 3 T. As we only want to change the contrast, not the anatomical information, our method uses the original image to guide the image-to-image translation process by adding structural information. The aim is that the mapped scans display increased comparability with scans of the target contrast for downstream tasks. We evaluate this method for the task of segmentation of cerebrospinal fluid, grey matter and white matter. Our method achieves good and consistent results for both directions of the mapping."

Adapting the source model to target data distribution at test-time is an efficient solution for the data-shift problem. Previous methods solve this by adapting the model to target distribution by using techniques like entropy minimization or regularization. In these methods, the models are still updated by back-propagation using an unsupervised loss on complete test data distribution. In real-world clinical settings, it makes more sense to adapt a model to a new test image on-the-fly and avoid model update during inference due to privacy concerns and lack of computing resource at deployment. To this end, we propose a new setting - On-the-Fly Adaptation which is zero-shot and episodic i.e., the model is adapted to a single image at a time and also does not perform any back-propagation during test-time). To achieve this, we propose a new framework called Adaptive UNet where each convolutional block is equipped with an adaptive batch normalization layer to adapt the features with respect to a domain code. The domain code is generated using a pre-trained encoder trained on a large corpus of medical images. During test-time, the model takes in just the new test image and generates a domain code to adapt the features of source model according to the test data. We validate the performance on both 2D and 3D data distribution shifts where we get a better performance compared to previous test-time adaptation methods."

Consequently, existing approaches neglect to explore attention mechanisms that can transfer texture from reference data to under-sampled data within a single MR sequence, which either limits the performance of these approaches or increases the difficulty of data acquisition. In this paper, we propose a novel $\textbf{T}$exture $\textbf{T}$ransformer $\textbf{M}$odule ($\textbf{TTM}$) for the reference-based MR image reconstruction. The TTM facilitates joint feature learning across under-sampled and reference data, so feature correspondences can be discovered by attention and accurate texture features can be leveraged during reconstruction. Notably, TTM can be stacked on prior MRI reconstruction methods to improve their performance. In addition, a $\textbf{R}$ecurrent $\textbf{T}$ransformer $\textbf{R}$econstruction backbone ($\textbf{RTR}$) is proposed to further improve the performance in a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of TTM and show that RTR can achieve the state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets.

The proposed SVD-DIP uses ad hoc convolutional layers whose pretrained parameters are decomposed via the singular value decomposition. Optimizing the DIP then solely consists in the fine-tuning of the singular values, while keeping the left and right singular vectors fixed. We thoroughly validate the proposed method on real-measured μCT data of a lotus root as well as two medical datasets (LoDoPaB and Mayo). We report significantly improved stability of the DIP optimization, by overcoming the overfitting to noise."

However, cell detection methods based on deep learning usually require a large number of annotated training samples, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain, and it is desirable to develop methods where detection networks can be adequately trained with only a few annotated training samples. Since unlabeled data is much less expensive to obtain, it is possible to address this problem with semi-supervised learning, where abundant unlabeled data is combined with the limited annotated training samples for network training. In this work, we propose a semi-supervised object detection method for cell detection in histopathology images, which is based on and improves the mean teacher framework. In standard mean teacher, the detection results on unlabeled data given by the teacher model can be noisy, which may negatively impact the learning of the student model. To address this problem, we propose to suppress the noise in the detection results of the teacher model by mixing the unlabeled training images with labeled training images of which the ground truth detection results are available. In addition, we propose to further incorporate a loss term that is robust to noise when the the student model learns from the teacher model. To evaluate the proposed method, experiments were performed on a publicly available dataset for multi-class cell detection, and the experimental results show that our method improves the performance of cell detection in histopathology images in the semi-supervised setting."

The challenge is that deep learning techniques, while very accurate, suffer from reduced performance when applied to out-of-domain data. This is a critical challenge for clinical translation, as models are typically trained using data available to the vendor, which is not from the target domain. To address this challenge, this study proposes a domain adaptation pipeline that employs an unsupervised framework to generate silver standard (pseudo) labels in the target domain, which is used to augment the gold standard (GS) source domain data. Five training regimes were tested on two validated Ki-67 scoring architectures (UV-Net and piNET), (1) SS Only: trained on target silver standard (SS) labels, (2) GS Only: trained on source GS labels, (3) Mixed: trained on target SS and source GS labels, (4) GS+SS: trained on source GS labels and fine-tuned on target SS labels, and our proposed method (5) SS+GS: trained on source SS labels and fine-tuned on source GS labels. The SS+GS method yielded significantly ($p<0.05$) higher PI accuracy ($95.9\\%$) and more consistent results compared to the GS Only model on target data.  Analysis of t-SNE plots showed features learned by the SS+GS models are more aligned for source and target data which results in improved generalization. The proposed pipeline provides an efficient method for learning the target distribution  without the need for manual annotations, which are time-consuming and costly to generate for medical images. This framework can be applied to any target site as a per-laboratory calibration method, for widescale deployment."

The second loss term leverages contrastive loss to directly optimize the representation from two randomly masked views. As an independent contribution, we extended ViT-AE++ to a 3D fashion for volumetric medical images.

To learn in a self-supervised fashion, our approach considers the semantic dependency that exists between different scales to generate a supervisory signal for inter-scale consistency and also imposes a spatial stability loss within the scale for self-supervised content clustering. While intra-scale and inter-scale consistency losses aim to increase features similarly within the cluster, we propose to include a cross-entropy loss function on top of the clustering score map to effectively model each cluster distribution and increase the decision boundary between clusters.

Digital histology imaging of biopsy tissue can be captured at arbitrary orientation and magnification and stored at different resolutions, resulting in cells appearing in different scales. When conventional CNNs are applied to histopathology image analysis, the generalization performance of models is limited because 1) a part of the parameters of filters are trained to fit rotation transformation, thus decreasing the capability of learning other discriminative features; 2) fixed-size filters trained on images at a given scale fail to generalize to those at different scales. To deal with these issues, we propose the Rotation-Scale Equivariant Steerable Filter (RSESF), which incorporates steerable filters and scale-space theory. The RSESF contains copies of filters that are linear combinations of Gaussian filters, whose direction is controlled by directional derivatives and whose scale parameters are trainable but constrained to span disjoint scales in successive layers of the network.

In medical data, the deformation fields are often predictable to a certain degree: the muscles and other tissues causing the motion-of-interest form shapes that may be used as a geometric prior. Using an Implicit Neural Representation to parameterize a deformation field allows the coordinate space to be chosen arbitrarily. We propose to curve this coordinate space around anatomical structures that influence the motion in our time series, yielding a space that is aligned with the expected motion. The geometric information is therefore explicitly encoded into the neural representation, reducing the complexity of the optimized deformation function. We design and evaluate this concept using an abdominal 3D cine-MRI dataset, where the motion of interest is bowel motility. We align the coordinate system of the neural representations with automatically extracted centerlines of the small intestine. We show that explicitly encoding the intestine geometry in the neural representations improves registration accuracy for bowel loops with active motility when compared to registration using neural representations in the original coordinate system. Additionally, we show that registration accuracy can be further improved using a model that combines a neural representation in image coordinates with a separate neural representation that operates in the proposed tangent coordinate system. This approach may improve the efficiency of deformable registration when describing motion-of-interest that is influenced by the shape of anatomical structures."

Taking the trained model from a source center as input, MATS adapts it to different target centers without data transmission or additional annotations, as inspired by the source data-free domain adaptation (SFDA) paradigm. The model adaptation in MATS is realized by a tooth-level feature prototype learning module, a progressive pseudo-labeling module and a tooth-prior regularized information maximization loss.

Predicting IAPs from the images is an important step toward better understanding the relationship between image appearance and IAPs. This in turn will advance the understanding of many concepts related to the generalizability of neural network models on medical images, including domain shift, domain adaptation, and data harmonization.

    abstract = "Renal transplantation emerges as the most effective solution for end-stage renal disease. Occurring from complex causes, a substantial risk of transplant chronic dysfunction persists and may lead to graft loss. Medical imaging plays a substantial role in renal transplant monitoring in clinical practice. However, graft supervision is multi-disciplinary, notably joining nephrology, urology, and radiology, while identifying robust biomarkers from such high-dimensional and complex data for prognosis is challenging. In this work, taking inspiration from the recent success of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose MEDIMP -- Medical Images and clinical Prompts -- a model to learn meaningful multi-modal representations of renal transplant Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (DCE MRI) by incorporating structural clinicobiological data after translating them into text prompts. MEDIMP is based on contrastive learning from joint text-image paired embeddings to perform this challenging task. Moreover, we propose a framework that generates medical prompts using automatic textual data augmentations from LLMs. Our goal is to learn meaningful manifolds of renal transplant DCE MRI, interesting for the prognosis of the transplant or patient status (2, 3, and 4 years after the transplant), fully exploiting the limited available multi-modal data most efficiently. Extensive experiments and comparisons with other renal transplant representation learning methods with limited data prove the effectiveness of MEDIMP in a relevant clinical setting, giving new directions toward medical prompts.

Existing iterative and learning-based approaches focus on accurate registration of folding patterns of the cerebral cortex, and assume that geometry predicts function and thus functional areas will also be well aligned. However, structure/functional variability of anatomically corresponding areas across subjects has been widely reported. In this work, we introduce a learning-based cortical registration framework, JOSA, which jointly aligns folding patterns and functional maps while simultaneously learning an optimal atlas. We demonstrate that JOSA can substantially improve registration performance in both anatomical and functional domains over existing methods. By employing a semi-supervised training strategy, the proposed framework obviates the need for functional data during inference, enabling its use in broad neuroscientific domains where functional data may not be observed. The source code of JOSA will be released to the public at https://voxelmorph.net."

We then present a geometric deep learning framework with the RegionPool and graph attention convolutions to perform binary classification on MCI subtypes (EMCI/LMCI). Our model does not require feature engineering and relies only on the relevant geometric information of T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signals. Our evaluation reveals the state-of-the-art classification capabilities of our network and shows that current empirically derived MCI subtypes cannot identify heterogeneous patterns of cortical atrophy at the MCI stage.

In this study, the KT was applied to a context aggregation network (CAN) for semantic segmentation of anatomical structures in knee MR images. In the proposed model, KAN3D, the input image is rearranged into a batch of downsampled images (KT) before the convolution operations, and then the voxels are rearranged back to their original positions (inverse KT) after the convolution operations to produce the predicted segmentation mask for the input image. Compared to the CAN3D (without the KT), the KAN3D was able to reduce overfitting without data augmentation while maintaining a fast training and inference time.

Self-Supervised learning methods have shown great success on natural images, and offer an attractive alternative also to microscopy images. However, we find that self-supervised learning techniques underperform on high content imaging assays. One challenge is the undesirable domain shifts present in the data known as batch effects, which may be caused by biological noise or uncontrolled experimental conditions. To this end, we introduce Cross-Domain Consistency Learning (CDCL), a novel approach that is able to learn in the presence of batch effects. CDCL enforces the learning of biological similarities while disregarding undesirable batch-specific signals, which leads to more useful and versatile representations. These features are organised according to their morphological changes and are more useful for downstream tasks - such as distinguishing treatments and mechanism of action."

Furthermore, as we show in this paper, current explanation techniques do not perform adequately in the multi-label scenario, in which multiple medical findings may co-occur in a single image. We propose Attri-Net, an inherently interpretable model for multi-label classification. Attri-Net is a powerful classifier that provides transparent, trustworthy, and human-understandable explanations. The model first generates class-specific attribution maps based on counterfactuals to identify which image regions correspond to certain medical findings. Then a simple logistic regression classifier is used to make predictions based solely on these attribution maps. We compare Attri-Net to five post-hoc explanation techniques and one inherently interpretable classifier on three chest X-ray datasets.

This training paradigm suffers from statistical heterogeneity between participating institutions’ local datasets, incurring convergence slowdown as well as potential accuracy loss compared to classical training.  To mitigate this effect, federated personalization emerged as the federated optimization of one model per distribution. We propose a novel personalization algorithm tailored to the feature shift induced by the usage of different scanners and acquisition parameters by different institutions. This method is the first to account for both inter and intra-institution feature shifts (multiple scanners used in a single institution). It is based on the computation, within each centre, of a series of radiomic features capturing the global texture of each 3D image volume, followed by a clustering analysis pooling all feature vectors transferred from the local institutions to the central server. Each computed clustered decentralized dataset (potentially including data from different institutions) then serves to finetune a global model obtained through classical federated learning. We validate our approach on the Federated Brain Tumor Segmentation 2022 Challenge dataset (FeTS2022)."

The proposed MTLRS consists of a unique cascading architecture, where a recurrent reconstruction network and a segmentation network inform each other through hidden states. The features of the two networks are shared and implicitly enforced as inductive bias. To evaluate the benefit of MTLRS, we compare performing the two tasks of accelerated-MRI reconstruction and MRI segmentation with pre-trained, sequential, end-to-end, and joint approaches. A synthetic multicoil dataset is used to train, validate, and test all approaches with five-fold cross-validation. The dataset consists of 3D FLAIR brain data of relapsing-remitting Multiple Sclerosis patients with known white matter lesions. The acquisition is prospectively undersampled by approximately 7.5 times compared to clinical standards. Reconstruction performance is evaluated by Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) and Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Segmentation performance is evaluated by Dice score for combined brain tissue and white matter lesion segmentation and by per lesion Dice score. Results show that MTLRS outperforms other evaluated approaches, providing high-quality reconstructions and accurate white matter lesion segmentation. A significant correlation was found between the performance of both tasks (SSIM and per lesion Dice score, $\rho=0.92$, $p=0.0005$). Our proposed MTLRS demonstrates that accelerated-MRI reconstruction and MRI segmentation can be effectively combined to improve performance on both tasks, potentially benefiting clinical settings."

In this study, we propose a modal-mixup data imputation method by randomly sampling incomplete samples and synthesizing them into complete data for auxiliary training.

An alternative approach is to use unsupervised anomaly detection, which only requires sample-level labels of healthy brains to create a reference representation. This reference representation can then be compared to unhealthy brain anatomy in a pixel-wise manner to identify abnormalities. To accomplish this, generative models are needed to create anatomically consistent MRI scans of healthy brains. While recent diffusion models have shown promise in this task, accurately generating the complex structure of the human brain remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose a method that reformulates the generation task of diffusion models as a patch-based estimation of healthy brain anatomy, using spatial context to guide and improve reconstruction. We evaluate our approach on data of tumors and multiple sclerosis lesions and demonstrate a relative improvement of 25.1\% compared to existing baselines."

A major difficulty in using MRI in this setting is the relatively long acquisition time (and, hence, increased cost) required for imaging in high spatio-temporal resolution, leading to the appearance of related motion artifacts and decrease in resolution. Compressed Sensing (CS) techniques have become a common tool to reduce MRI acquisition time by subsampling images in the $k$-space according to some acquisition trajectory. Several studies have particularly focused on applying deep learning techniques to learn these acquisition trajectories in order to attain better image reconstruction, rather than using some predefined set of trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, learning acquisition trajectories has been only explored in the context of static MRI. In this study, we consider acquisition trajectory learning in the dynamic imaging setting. We design an end-to-end pipeline for the joint optimization of multiple per-frame acquisition trajectories along with a reconstruction neural network, and demonstrate improved image reconstruction quality in shorter acquisition times. The code for reproducing all experiments will accompany the paper."

One such type of graphs are predefined with fixed size and connectivity to represent a reference of anatomical regions of interest, thus known as templates. This work explores the potentials in these GNNs with common topology for establishing spatial correspondence, implicitly maintained during segmenting two or more images. With an example application of registering local vertebral sub-regions found in CT images, our experimental results showed that the GNN-based segmentation is capable of accurate and reliable localisation of the same interventionally interesting structures between images, not limited to the segmentation classes. The reported average target registration errors of 2.2$\pm$1.3 mm and 2.7$\pm$1.4 mm, for aligning holdout test images with a reference and for aligning two test images, respectively, were by a considerable margin lower than those from the tested non-learning and learning-based registration algorithms. Further ablation studies assess the contributions towards the registration performance, from individual components in the originally segmentation-purposed network and its training algorithm. The results highlight that the proposed segmentation-in-lieu-of-registration approach shares methodological similarity with existing registration methods, such as the use of displacement smoothness constraint and point distance minimisation albeit on non-grid graphs, which interestingly yielded benefits for both segmentation and registration. We therefore conclude that the template-based GNN segmentation can effectively establish spatial correspondence in our application, without any other dedicated registration algorithms."

In this way, it can identify class level features of a specific class from a small number of input images together with the knowledge transferred from visually similar classes, leading to more robust sample synthesis.

However, the high angular resolution dMRI acquisitions capable of fitting the microstructural models needed for tractography are often time-consuming and not routinely collected clinically, restricting the scope of tractography analyses. To address this limitation, we build on recent advances in deep learning which have demonstrated that streamline propagation can be learned from dMRI directly without traditional model fitting. Specifically, we propose learning the streamline propagator from T1w MRI to facilitate arbitrary tractography analyses when dMRI is unavailable. To do so, we present a novel convolutional-recurrent neural network (CoRNN) trained in a teacher-student framework that leverages T1w MRI, associated anatomical context, and streamline memory from data acquired for the Human Connectome Project. We characterize our approach under two common tractography paradigms, WM bundle analysis and structural connectomics, and find approximately a 5-15\% difference between measures computed from streamlines generated with our approach and those generated using traditional dMRI tractography. When placed in the literature, these results suggest that the accuracy of WM measures computed from T1w MRI with our method is on the level of scan-rescan dMRI variability and raise an important question: is tractography truly a microstructural phenomenon, or has dMRI merely facilitated its discovery and implementation?"

In practice, Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) modalities, which offer different contrasts to elucidate tissue properties, provide comprehensive information regarding the brain’s structure and also potential clues for detecting tumors. Hence, multi-modal MRI is commonly utilized for the diagnosis of brain tumors. However, since the set of acquired modalities may vary between clinical sites, brain tumor studies may miss one or two MRI modalities. To address missing information in an end-to-end manner, we propose MMCFormer, a novel missing modality compensation network. Our strategy builds upon 3D efficient transformer blocks and uses a co-training strategy to effectively train a missing modality network. To ensure feature consistency in a multi-scale fashion, MMCFormer utilizes global contextual agreement modules in each scale of the encoders. Furthermore, to transfer modality-specific representations, we propose to incorporate auxiliary tokens in the bottleneck stage to model interaction between full and missing-modality paths. On top of that, we include feature consistency losses to reduce the domain gap in network prediction and increase the prediction reliability for the missing modality path. Extensive experiments on the BraTS 2018 dataset demonstrate the benefits of our approach compared to competing approaches.

In this study, we present a prior guided coarse-to-fine framework for efficient and accurate 3D medical landmark detection; we make use of the prior information that in specific settings physicians annotate multiple landmarks on a same slice. The coarse stage uses coordinate regression on downsampled 3D images to maintain the structural relationships across different landmarks. The fine stage categorizes landmarks as correlated and independent landmarks based on their annotation prior. For independent landmarks, we train multiple models to capture local features and ensure reliable local predictions. For correlated landmarks, we mimic the manual annotation process and propose a correlated landmark detection model that merges information from various patches to query key slices and identify correlated landmarks.

    abstract = "Deep learning-based models are widely used for disease classification in chest radiographs. This exam can be performed in one of two projections (posteroanterior or anteroposterior), depending on the direction that the X-ray beam travels through the body. Since projection visibly affects the way anatomical structures appear in the scans, it may introduce bias in classifiers, especially when spurious correlations between a given disease and a projection occur. This paper examines the influence of chest radiograph projection on the performance of deep learning-based classification models and proposes an approach to mitigate projection-induced bias. Results show that a DenseNet-121 model is better at classifying images from the most representative projection in the data set, suggesting that projection is taken into account by the classifier. Moreover, this model can classify chest X-ray projection better than any of the fourteen radiological findings considered, without being explicitly trained for that task, putting it at high risk for projection bias. We propose a label-conditional gradient reversal framework to make the model insensitive to projection, by forcing the extracted features to be simultaneously good for disease classification and bad for projection classification, resulting in a framework with reduced projection-induced bias."

Therefore, our work investigates the performance of recent methods for the fusion of rich image data and heterogeneous tabular data. Those data may include patient demographics as well as laboratory data, e.g., prostate-specific antigen (PSA). Experiments on the large dataset (3800 subjects) indicated that when using the fusion method with demographic data in clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection tasks, the mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC AUC) has improved significantly from 0.736 to 0.765.

We collected 7,378 chest X-ray images from the *****, which were labeled for misplacement of nasogastric and endotracheal tube catheters, and included pixel-wise annotation. Moreover, the CLiP dataset was used as an unlabeled dataset for semi-supervised learning. We used a hybrid U-Net architecture with an added classification head to perform simultaneous segmentation of the catheter and misplacement classification. Our model achieved an average AUC of 0.977 for classification and a average Dice score of 0.598 for segmentation."

However, it also comes with new challenges, requiring strong team coordination and effective OR management. Automatic detection of surgical activities is a key requirement for developing AI-based intelligent tools to tackle these challenges. The current state-of-the-art surgical activity recognition methods however operate on image-based representations and depend on large-scale labeled datasets whose collection is time-consuming and resource-expensive. This work proposes a new sample-efficient and object-based approach for surgical activity recognition in the OR. Our method focuses on the geometric arrangements between clinicians and surgical devices, thus utilizing the significant object interaction dynamics in the OR. We conduct experiments in a low-data regime study for long video activity recognition. We also benchmark our method against other object-centric approaches on clip-level action classification and show superior performance."

    abstract = "Performance of deep learning algorithms varies due to their development data and training method, but also due to several stochastic processes during training. Due to these random factors, a single training run may not accurately reflect the performance of a given training method. Statistical comparisons in literature between different deep learning training methods typically ignore this performance variation between training runs and incorrectly claim significance of changes in training method. We hypothesize that the impact of such performance variation is substantial, such that it may invalidate biomedical competition leaderboards and some scientific papers. To test this, we investigate the reproducibility of training deep learning algorithms for medical image analysis. We repeated training runs from prior scientific studies: three diagnostic tasks (pancreatic cancer detection in CT, clinically significant prostate cancer detection in MRI, and lung nodule malignancy risk estimation in low-dose CT) and two organ segmentation tasks (pancreas segmentation in CT and prostate segmentation in MRI). A previously published top-performing algorithm for each task was trained multiple times to determine the variance in model performance. For all three diagnostic algorithms, performance variation from retraining was significant compared to data variance. Statistically comparing independently trained algorithms from the same training method using the same dataset should follow the null hypothesis, but we observed claimed significance with a p-value below 0.05 in $15\\%$ of comparisons with conventional testing (paired bootstrapping). We conclude that variance in model performance due to retraining is substantial and should be accounted for. "

Timing of the contrast media injection specifically influences the level of arterial enhancement, and it is aimed to allow optimal assessment of the coronary artery morphology. However, a consensus on an optimal acquisition protocol that can account for the large variety in patient cohorts has not been reached, commonly resulting in suboptimal arterial enhancement. In this work, we propose a generative adversarial network for the retrospective correction of contrast media attenuation in CCTA, thus reducing the dependency on an optimal timing protocol at acquisition. We develop and evaluate the method in a set of 1,179 CCTA scans with varying levels of contrast enhancement. We evaluate the consistency of intensity values in the coronary arteries and evaluate performance of coronary centerline extraction as a commonly performed analysis task. Results show that correction of contrast media attenuation values in CCTA scans is feasible, and that it improves the performance of automatic centerline extraction. The method may allow improved analysis of coronary arteries  in CCTA scans with suboptimal contrast enhancement."

    abstract = {Deep learning has led to many advances in medical image analysis for various clinical problems. However, most deep learning models are known to be sensitive to differences in the training and test data distributions, which can lead to a decrease in accuracy when applied in real-life scenarios. Thus far, various techniques have been developed to tackle this problem, primarily focusing on harmonizing feature representations from different datasets. Due to the recent increased interest in causal approaches in deep learning, explainable harmonization techniques have gained momentum lately but have not been applied broadly yet. Our study proposes a causal flow-based technique to overcome the problem of different feature distributions in multi-site data used for Parkinson\'s disease (PD) classification. Feature distributions from six different sites, with a total of 415 subjects (PD: 263, healthy controls: 152), were used for the experiments. A counterfactual approach to answer the question, How would brain MRI features appear if they were obtained at a different site?\" was developed using a causal normalizing flow. When tested on features from a previously unseen site, the counterfactual-based classifier demonstrated superior performance (weighted f1 = 0.68) compared to a classifier trained on purely observational data (weighted f1 = 0.36) and improved accuracy compared to a harmonization technique typically used in neurological settings (weighted f1 = 0.5). These results show that the proposed technique can effectively correct differences in multi-site feature distributions to facilitate generalizable deep-learning models.}

These assumptions are at odds with neuroscientific evidence that brain graphs are time-varying with a connectivity structure that depends on the choice of functional connectivity measure. Noisy brain graphs that do not truly represent the underling fMRI data can have a detrimental impact on the performance of GNNs. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Brain Graph Structure Learning (DBGSL), a novel method for learning the optimal time-varying dependency structure of fMRI data induced by a downstream prediction task. Experiments demonstrate DBGSL achieves state-of-the-art performance for sex classification using real-world resting-state and task fMRI data. Moreover, analysis of the learnt dynamic graphs highlights prediction-related brain regions which align with existing neuroscience literature."

Specifically, DBGDGM represents brain graph nodes as embeddings sampled from a distribution over communities that evolve over time. We parameterise this community distribution using neural networks that learn from subject and node embeddings as well as past community assignments. Experiments demonstrate DBGDGM outperforms baselines in graph generation, dynamic link prediction, and is comparable for graph classification.

However, the procedure experiences high miss rates due to polyp heterogeneity and inter-observer dependency. Hence, several deep learning powered systems have been proposed considering the criticality of polyp detection and segmentation in clinical practices. Despite achieving improved outcomes, the existing automated approaches are inefficient in attaining real-time processing speed. Moreover, they suffer from a significant performance drop when evaluated on inter-patient data, especially those collected from different centers. Therefore, we intend to develop a novel real-time deep learning based architecture, Transformer based Residual network (TransNetR), for colon polyp segmentation and evaluate its diagnostic performance. The proposed architecture, TransNetR, is an encoder-decoder network that consists of a pre-trained ResNet50 as the encoder, three decoder blocks, and an upsampling layer at the end of the network. TransNetR obtains a high dice coefficient of 0.8706 and a mean Intersection over union of 0.8016 and retains a real-time processing speed of 54.60 on the Kvasir-SEG dataset. Apart from this,  the major contribution of the work lies in exploring the generalizability of the TransNetR by testing the proposed algorithm on the out-of-distribution (test distribution is unknown and different from training distribution) dataset. As a use case, we tested our proposed algorithm on the PolypGen (6 unique centers) dataset and two other popular polyp segmentation benchmarking datasets. We obtained state-of-the-art performance on all three datasets during out-of-distribution testing. The source code of TransNetR is available at https://github.com/Anonymous/TransNetR. "

Unfortunately, due to imaging restrictions, the more routinely used hematoxylin and eosin (H\&E) stain is typically unavailable with MxIF on the same tissue section. As biological H\&E staining is not feasible, previous efforts have been made to obtain H\&E whole slide image (WSI) from MxIF via deep learning empowered virtual staining. However, the tiling effect is a long-lasting problem in high-resolution WSI-wise synthesis. The MxIF to H\&E synthesis is no exception. Limited by computational resources, the cross-stain image synthesis is typically performed at the patch-level. Thus, discontinuous intensities might be visually identified along with the patch boundaries assembling all individual patches back to a WSI. In this work, we propose a deep learning based unpaired high-resolution image synthesis method to obtain virtual H\&E WSIs from MxIF WSIs (each with 27 markers/stains) with reduced tiling effects. Briefly, we first extend the CycleGAN framework by adding simultaneous nuclei and mucin segmentation supervision as spatial constraints. Then, we introduce a random sliding window shifting strategy during the optimized inference stage to alleviate the tiling effects. The validation results show that our spatially constrained synthesis method achieves a 56\% performance gain for the downstream cell segmentation task. The proposed inference method reduces the tiling effects by using 50\% fewer computation resources without compromising performance. The proposed random sliding window inference method is a plug-and-play module, which can be generalized and used for other high-resolution WSI image synthesis applications."

However, as the number of cascades increases, the improvements in reconstruction tend to become marginal, indicating possible excess model capacity. Knowledge distillation (KD) is an emerging technique to compress these models, in which a trained deep teacher\' network is used to distill knowledge to a smaller student\' network, such that the student  learns to mimic the behavior of the teacher. Most KD methods focus on effectively training the student with a pre-trained teacher that is unaware of the student model. We propose SFT-KD-Recon, a student-friendly teacher training approach along with the student as a prior step to KD to make the teacher aware of the student\'s structure and capacity and enable aligning the teacher\'s representations with the student.  In SFT, the teacher is jointly trained with the unfolded branch configurations of the student blocks using three loss terms - teacher-reconstruction loss, student-reconstruction loss, and teacher-student imitation loss, followed by KD of the student. We perform extensive experiments for MRI acceleration in 4x and 5x under-sampling, on the brain and cardiac datasets on five KD methods using the proposed approach as a prior step. We consider the DC-CNN architecture and setup teacher as D5C5 (141765 parameters), and student as D3C5 (49285 parameters) denoting 2.87:1 compression.  Results show that (i) our approach consistently improves the KD methods with improved reconstruction performance and image quality, and (ii) the student distilled using our approach is competitive with the teacher, with the performance gap reduced from 0.53 dB to 0.03 dB."

In this paper, we first conduct a theoretical analysis on the FL algorithm to reveal the problem of model aggregation during training on non-iid data. With the insights gained through the analysis, we propose a simple yet effective method, federated cross learning (FedCross), to tackle this challenging problem. Unlike the conventional FL methods that combine multiple individually trained local models on a server node, our FedCross sequentially trains the global model across different clients in a round-robin manner, and thus the entire training procedure does not involve any model aggregation steps. To further improve its performance to be comparable with the centralized learning method, we combine the FedCross with an ensemble learning mechanism to compose a federated cross ensemble learning (FedCrossEns) method. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments using a set of public datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed FedCross training strategy outperforms the mainstream FL methods on non-iid data. In addition to improving the segmentation performance, our FedCrossEns can further provide a quantitative estimation of the model uncertainty, demonstrating the effectiveness and clinical significance of our designs.

Unfortunately, recent studies have indeed shown significant biases in DL models across demographic subgroups (e.g., race, sex, age) in the context of medical image analysis, indicating a lack of fairness in the models. Although several methods have been proposed in the ML literature to mitigate a lack of fairness in DL models, they focus entirely on the absolute performance between groups without considering their effect on uncertainty estimation. In this work, we present the first exploration of the effect of popular fairness models on overcoming biases across subgroups in medical image analysis in terms of bottom-line performance, and their effects on uncertainty quantification. We perform extensive experiments on three different clinically relevant tasks: (i) skin lesion classification, (ii) brain tumour segmentation, and (iii) Alzheimer\'s disease clinical score regression. Our results indicate that popular ML methods, such as data-balancing and distributionally robust optimization, succeed in mitigating fairness issues in terms of the model performances for some of the tasks. However, this can come at the cost of poor uncertainty estimates associated with the model predictions. This tradeoff must be mitigated if fairness models are to be adopted in medical image analysis.

Structured reporting and standardized reports, on the other hand, can provide consistency and formalize the evaluation of clinical correctness. However, high-quality annotations for structured reporting are scarce. Therefore, we propose a method to predict clinical findings defined by sentences in structured reporting templates, which can be used to fill such templates. The approach involves training a contrastive language-image model using chest X-rays and related free-text radiological reports, then creating textual prompts for each structured finding and optimizing a classifier to predict clinical findings in the medical image. Results show that even with limited image-level annotations for training, the method can accomplish the structured reporting tasks of severity assessment of cardiomegaly and localizing pathologies in chest X-rays."

Surprisingly, we observe that data consistency is not heavily affected  even for these poor quality reconstructions, motivating the need for better regularization for the networks. We demonstrate the feasibility of  universal attacks and study attack transferability across different methods.  We analyze robustness to attacks causing localized changes in clinically relevant regions. Both classical approaches and deep networks are affected by such attacks leading to change in  visual appearance of localized lesions, for extremely small perturbations.

However, CNNs are limited in their ability to learn global features within an entire volume. In this study, we propose a Transformer-based model for predicting recurrence-free survival (RFS) in OPSCC patients, called TransRP. TransRP consists of a CNN encoder to extract rich PET/CT image features, a Transformer encoder to learn global context features, and a fully connected network to incorporate clinical data for RFS prediction. We investigated three different methods for combining clinical features into TransRP. The experiments were conducted using the public HECKTOR 2022 challenge dataset, which includes pretreatment PET/CT scans, Gross Tumor Volume masks, clinical data, and RFS for OPSCC patients. The dataset was split into a test set (n = 120) and a training set (n = 362) for five-fold cross-validation. The results show that TransRP achieved the highest test concordance index of 0.698 (an improvement > 2\%) in RFS prediction compared to several state-of-the-art clinical and CNN-based methods.

We validate the performance of our proposed approach on two datasets we collect from two hospitals using different ultrasound machines. We compare different architectures, with our best-performing architecture achieving over 90\% classification accuracy on distinguishing between good and poor quality segmentation masks from an unseen dataset. Additionally, there was only a 1.45-days difference between the gestational age reported by doctors and estimated based on CRL measurements using well-segmented masks. On the other hand, this difference increased and reached up to 7.73 days when we calculated CRL from the poorly segmented masks. As a result, AI-based approaches can potentially aid fetal ultrasound segmentation quality assessment and might detect poor segmentation in real-time screening in the future."

    abstract = "Recently, deep learning has produced encouraging results for kidney stone classification using endoscope images. However, the shortage of annotated training data poses a severe problem in improving the performance and generalization ability of the trained model. It is thus crucial to fully exploit the limited data at hand. In this paper, we propose SegPrompt to alleviate the data shortage problems by exploiting segmentation maps from two aspects. First, SegPrompt integrates segmentation maps to facilitate classification training so that the classification model is aware of the regions of interest. The proposed method allows the image and segmentation tokens to interact with each other to fully utilize the segmentation map information. Second, we use the segmentation maps as prompts to tune the pretrained deep model, resulting in much fewer trainable parameters than vanilla finetuning. We perform extensive experiments on the collected kidney stone dataset. The results show that SegPrompt can achieve an advantageous balance between the model fitting ability and the generalization ability, eventually leading to an effective model with limited training data."

Inspired by the proofreading consensus of experts, we established a paradigm to acquire priori knowledge of cellular characteristics and ultrastructures, as well as determine the connectivity of neural circuits simultaneously. Following this novel paradigm, we were keen to bring the Intra- and Inter-Cellular Awareness back when Tracking and Segmenting neurons in connectomics. Our proposed method (II-CATS) utilizes few-shot learning techniques to encode the internal neurite representation and its learnable components, which could significantly impact neuron tracings. We further go beyond the original expected run length (ERL) metric by focusing on biological constraints (bERL) or spanning from the nucleus to spines (nERL). With the evaluation of these metrics, we perform typical experiments on multiple electron microscopy datasets on diverse animals and scales. In particular, our proposed method is naturally suitable for tracking neurons that have been identified by staining."

T2-shuffling is widely used to resolve temporal signal dynamics in FSE acquisitions by exploiting temporal correlations via linear latent space and a predefined regularizer. However, predefined regularizers fail to exploit the incoherence especially for 2D acquisitions.Recent self-supervised learning methods achieve high-fidelity reconstructions by learning a regularizer from undersampled data without a standard supervised training data set. In this work, we propose a novel approach that utilizes a self supervised learning framework to learn a regularizer constrained on a linear latent space which improves time-resolved FSE images reconstruction quality. Additionally, in regimes without groundtruth sensitivity maps, we propose joint estimation of coil-sensitivity maps using an iterative reconstruction technique. Our technique functions is in a zero-shot fashion, as it only utilizes data from a single scan of highly undersampled time series images. We perform experiments on simulated and retrospective in-vivo data to evaluate the performance of the proposed zero-shot learning method for temporal FSE reconstruction. The results demonstrate the success of our proposed method where NMSE and SSIM are significantly increased and the artifacts are reduced."

    abstract = "Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is considered the gold standard of medical imaging because of the excellent soft-tissue contrast exhibited in the images reconstructed by the MR pipeline, which enables the human radiologist to discern many pathologies easily. More recently, Deep Learning (DL) models have also achieved state-of-the-art performance in diagnosing multiple diseases using these reconstructed images as input. However, the image reconstruction process within the MR pipeline, which requires the use of complex hardware and adjustment of a large number of scanner parameters, is highly susceptible to the noise of various forms resulting in arbitrary artifacts within the images. Furthermore, the noise distribution is not stationary and varies within a machine, across machines, and patients, leading to varying artifacts within the images. Unfortunately, DL models are quite sensitive to these varying artifacts as it leads to changes in the input data distribution between the training and testing phases. The lack of robustness of these models against varying artifacts impedes their use in medical applications where safety is critical. In this work, we focus on improving the generalization performance of these models in the presence of multiple varying artifacts that manifest due to the complexity of the MR data acquisition. In our experiments, we observe that Batch Normalization (BN), a widely used technique during the training of DL models for medical image analysis, is a significant cause of performance degradation in these changing environments. As a solution, we propose to use other normalization techniques, such as Group Normalization (GN) and Layer Normalization (LN), to inject robustness into model performance against varying image artifacts. Through a systematic set of experiments, we show that GN and LN provide better accuracy for various MR artifacts and distribution shifts."

    abstract = "Selective experience replay is a popular strategy for integrating lifelong learning with deep reinforcement learning. Selective experience replay aims to recount selected experiences from previous tasks to avoid catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, selective experience replay based techniques are model agnostic and allow experiences to be shared across different models. However, storing experiences from all previous tasks make lifelong learning using selective experience replay computationally very expensive and impractical as the number of tasks increase. To that end, we propose a reward distribution-preserving coreset compression technique for compressing experience replay buffers stored for selective experience replay.   We evaluated the coreset lifelong deep reinforcement learning technique on the brain tumor segmentation (BRATS) dataset for the task of ventricle localization and on the whole-body MRI for localization of left knee cap, left kidney, right trochanter, left lung, and spleen. The coreset lifelong learning models trained on a sequence of 10 different brain MR imaging environments demonstrated excellent performance localizing the ventricle with a mean pixel error distance of 12.93, 13.46, 17.75, and 18.55 for the compression ratios of 10x, 20x, 30x, and 40x, respectively. In comparison, the conventional lifelong learning model localized the ventricle with a mean pixel distance of 10.87. Similarly, the coreset lifelong learning models trained on whole-body MRI demonstrated no significant difference (p=0.28) between the 10x compressed coreset lifelong learning models and conventional lifelong learning models for all the landmarks. The mean pixel distance for the 10x compressed models across all the landmarks was 25.30, compared to 19.24 for the conventional lifelong learning models. Our results demonstrate that the potential of the coreset-based ERB compression method for compressing experiences without a significant drop in performance."

    abstract = "Histopathology is critical for the diagnosis of many diseases, including cancer. These protocols typically require pathologists to manually evaluate slides under a microscope, which is time-consuming and subjective, leading to interest in machine learning to automate analysis. However, computational techniques are limited by batch effects, where technical factors like differences in preparation protocol or scanners can alter the appearance of slides, causing models trained on one institution or patient to fail when generalizing to others. Here, we propose a domain adaptation method that improves the generalization of histopathological models to data from unseen institutions, without the need for labels or retraining in these new settings. Our approach introduces an optimal transport (OT) loss, that extends adversarial methods that penalize models if images from different institutions can be distinguished in their representation space. Unlike previous methods, which operate on single samples, our loss accounts for distributional differences between batches of images. We show that on the Camelyon17 dataset, while both methods can adapt to global differences in color distribution, only our OT loss can reliably classify a cancer phenotype unseen during training. Together, our results suggest that OT improves generalization on rare but critical phenotypes that may only make up a small fraction of the total tiles and variation in a slide.  "

While most explainable deep learning applications use post hoc methods (such as GradCAM) to generate feature attribution maps, there is a new type of case-based reasoning models, namely ProtoPNet and its variants, which identify prototypes during training and compare input image patches with those prototypes. We propose the first medical prototype network (MProtoNet) to extend ProtoPNet to brain tumor classification with 3D multi-parametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) data. To address different requirements between 2D natural images and 3D mpMRIs especially in terms of localizing attention regions, a new attention module with soft masking and online-CAM loss is introduced. Soft masking helps sharpen attention maps, while online-CAM loss directly utilizes image-level labels when training the attention module. MProtoNet achieves statistically significant improvements in interpretability metrics of both correctness and localization coherence (with a best activation precision of $0.713\pm0.058$) without human-annotated labels during training, when compared with GradCAM and several ProtoPNet variants.

    abstract = "Digital Breast Tomosynthesis (DBT) is an X-ray imaging modality enabling the reconstruction of 3D volumes of breasts. DBT is mainly used for cancer screening, and is intended to replace conventional mammography in the coming years. However, DBT reconstructions are impeded by several types of artefacts induced by the geometry of the device itself, degrading the image quality and limiting its resolution along the thickness of the compressed breast. In this study, we propose a deep-learning-based pipeline to address the DBT reconstruction problem, focusing on the removal of sparse-view and limited-angle artefacts. Specifically, this procedure is composed of two steps: a classic reconstruction algorithm is first applied on normalised projections, then a deep neural network is tasked with erasing the artefacts present in the obtained volumes. A major difficulty to solve our problem is the lack of real conditions artefact-free data. To overcome this complication, we resort to a new dataset comprised of synthetic breast texture phantoms. We then show that our training method and database strategy are promising to tackle the problem as they improve the informational value of planes orthogonal to the detector, which are not currently used by radiologists due to their poor quality. Eventually, we assess the impact of removing the bias components from the network and using stacks of slices as inputs, with regard to the generalisation ability of our approach on both synthetic and clinical data."

Though several studies have compared self-supervised approaches in natural image classification, object detection, and medical image interpretation, there is limited data on which approaches learn robust representations for risk prediction. We present a comparison of semi- and self-supervised learning to predict mortality risk using chest x-ray images.

    abstract = "Positron emission tomography (PET) is an important functional medical imaging technique often used in the evaluation of certain brain disorders, whose reconstruction problem is ill-posed. The vast majority of reconstruction methods in PET imaging, both iterative and deep learning, return a single estimate without quantifying the associated uncertainty. Due to ill-posedness and noise, a single solution can be misleading or inaccurate. Thus, providing a measure of uncertainty in PET image reconstruction can help medical practitioners in making critical decisions. This paper proposes a deep learning-based method for uncertainty quantification in PET image reconstruction via posterior sampling. The method is based on training a conditional generative adversarial network whose generator approximates sampling from the posterior in Bayesian inversion. The generator is conditioned on reconstruction from a low-dose PET scan obtained by a conventional reconstruction method and a high-quality magnetic resonance image and learned to estimate a corresponding standard-dose PET scan reconstruction. We show that the proposed model generates high-quality posterior samples and yields physically-meaningful uncertainty estimates."

We present the first transfer learning-based LVV segmentation method for fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI. To mitigate covariate shifts between source and target domains, this work proposes an domain adaptation method that optimizes performance on three target datasets. Silver standard (SS) masks were generated from the target domain using a novel conventional image processing ventricular segmentation algorithm and used to supplement the gold standard (GS) data from the source domain, Canadian Atherosclerosis Imaging Network (CAIN). Four models were tested on held-out test sets from four datasets: 1) SS+GS: trained on target SS masks and fine-tuned on source GS masks, 2) GS+SS: trained on source GS masks and fine-tuned on target SS masks, 3) trained on source GS (GS CAIN Only) and 4) trained on target SS masks (SS Only). The SS+GS model had the best and most consistent performance (mean DSC = 0.89, CoV = 0.05) and showed significantly p < 0.05) higher DSC compared to the GS-only model on three target domains. Results suggest pre-training with noisy labels from the target domain allows the model to adapt to the dataset-specific characteristics and provides robust parameter initialization while fine-tuning with GS masks allows the model to learn detailed features. This method has wide application to other medical imaging problems where labeled data is scarce, and can be used as a per-dataset calibration method to accelerate wide-scale adoption. "

SSM has benefitted largely from advances in deep learning where statis- tical representations of anatomies (e.g., point distribution models or PDMs) are inferred directly from images, alleviating the need for a time-consuming and expensive workflow of anatomy segmentation, shape registration, and model optimization. Nonetheless, to date, existing deep learning methods do not consider the rigid pose transformation of shapes or anatomy of interest. They also require a tight bounding box to be defined over the image of anatomy-of-interest before feeding the image to the deep network for network training and inference. In this paper, we propose a deep learning framework that simultaneously detects and segments the anatomy of interest, estimate the rigid transformation with respect to the population mean (average) using a spatial transformer, and estimates the corresponding statistical representation of that anatomy, all directly from unsegmented 3D image without the need for any additional supervision. Furthermore, we leverage the segmentation task to provide an attention model for the sub-network that estimates shape representation, giving more accurate shape statistics for shape analysis."

This is critical for translation and widescale adoption, since current models cannot be readily applied to data from new institutions.  In this work, we evaluate several intensity standardization methods for MRI as a preprocessing step for WML segmentation in multi-centre Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) MRI. We evaluate a method specifically developed for FLAIR MRI called IAMLAB along with other popular normalization techniques such as White-strip, Nyul and Z-score. We proposed an Ensemble model that combines predictions from each of these models.  A skip-connection UNet (SC UNet) was trained on the standardized images, as well as the original data and segmentation performance was evaluated over several dimensions. The training (in-distribution) data consists of a single study, of 60 volumes, and the test (OOD) data is 128 unseen volumes from three clinical cohorts. Results show IAMLAB and Ensemble provide higher WML segmentation performance compared to models from original data or other normalization methods. IAMLAB \& Ensemble have the highest dice similarity coefficient (DSC) on the in-distribution data (0.78 \& 0.80) and on clinical OOD data. DSC was significantly higher for IAMLAB compared to the original data (p<0.05) for all lesion categories (LL>25mL: 0.77 vs. 0.71; 10mL<= LL<25mL: 0.66 vs. 0.61; LL<10mL: 0.53 vs. 0.52).  The IAMLAB and Ensemble normalization methods are mitigating MRI domain shift and are optimal for DL-based WML segmentation in unseen FLAIR data."
