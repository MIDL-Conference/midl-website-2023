#### Transport-based image representations for better machine learning

**Abstract:** Mathematical and computational modeling techniques play a crucial role in advancing research in biomedical and clinical sciences. As the problems being tackled become increasingly complex, machine learning methods such as deep learning have emerged as a leading approach for analyzing complex image data. Although the results of deep learning are often impressive on specific datasets, its limitations with respect to accuracy, complexity, the need for large datasets, energy consumption, robustness, and interpretability suggest that further improvements are necessary to mitigate the risks of stagnation and ensure the development of safe and reliable methods for biomedical applications. In this talk I will describe a new, optimal transport-based, image representation framework that enables users to solve regression and machine learning problems more easily, significantly enhancing the impact of deep and other machine learning techniques in medicine and biology. This framework can be regarded as a confound removal step, whereby transport confounds such as translation, scaling, and deformations can be modeled and filtered to produce normalized representations. Demonstrations in radiology and digital pathology applications will be shown.

**Biography:** Gustavo Rohde earned B.S. degrees in physics and mathematics in 1999, and the M.S. degree in electrical engineering in 2001 from Vanderbilt University. He received a doctorate in applied mathematics and scientific computation in 2005 from the University of Maryland. He has served as associate editor for numerous journals including IEEE TIP, Cytometry A, BMC Bioinformatics, IEEE Signal Processing Letters, and Sampling Theory, Signal Processing and Data Analysis. He was program co-chair for IEEE ISBI 21, and past member of the BDMA NIH study section. He was an ISAC council member from 2014-2016.

#### Integrating Radiomics and Autonomous AI in the clinical workflow: Economic Considerations and Regulatory Challenges


**Abstract:** Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to revolutionize healthcare, particularly in the field of medical imaging and radiomics-based devices. These devices hold significant promise for improving patient outcomes, enhancing diagnostic accuracy, and optimizing treatment plans. However, integrating AI into clinical practice requires addressing a range of scientific, regulatory, and economic challenges.
In this presentation, we will examine issues of bias, data drift, and model drift. We will discuss the scientific methods and approaches that can help address these and ensure the accuracy and reliability of radiomics-based medical devices.
We will also explore regulatory challenges associated with the integration of imaging analytics and radiomics models into healthcare, including gaining regulatory approval for AI models and ensuring compliance with privacy and security regulations. We will examine the regulatory environment in the US and globally, and discuss the role of regulatory bodies in evaluating AI-based medical devices.
Finally, we will discuss the economic implications of imaging analytics in healthcare, including the costs associated with implementing AI technologies and the potential return on investment. We will examine the differences between traditional and diagnostic AI versus autonomous AI and discuss the cost-benefit analysis of implementing these technologies.
Throughout the presentation, we will illustrate these challenges and solutions with real-world examples and use cases.

**Biography:** Yelena Yesha received her B.Sc. degrees in Computer Science and in Applied Mathematics from York University, Toronto, Canada, and her M.Sc. degree and Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from The Ohio State University. She was the Founding Director of the National Science Foundation Center for Accelerated Real Time Analytics (CARTA), an NSF-funded Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) that aims to develop long-term partnerships among industry, academia, and government. She serves as the Innovation Officer and Head of International Relations at the Miami University Institute for Data Science and Computing. She is currently working with leading industrial companies and government agencies on innovative technology in the areas of blockchains, cybersecurity, and big data analytics with applications to electronic commerce, climate change, and digital healthcare. In particular, she is leading collaborative efforts with the FDA to develop new technologies and approaches for imaging analytics regulation. Dr. Yesha is a fellow of the IBM Centre for Advanced Studies.

#### Translating University Research Through Startups to the Real World

**Abstract:** Not only is surgeon-engineer teamwork the key to great new ideas in medicine, but it can also be equally valuable in translating university discoveries into real real-world products with the potential to help physicians save lives. This talk will describe how a surgeon (Herrell) and an engineer (Webster) created a new endoscopic surgical robot from napkin sketch to university research program, to startup company, all the way to producing a commercial surgical robot slated for first-in-human studies in less than a year. In particular, the talk will share experiences and insights on how startups can resonate with and complement the work we already do as faculty members, and how interdisciplinary collaboration has been the key for us in making our startup, Virtuoso Surgical, work. We will also discuss some creative funding approaches that have accelerated our startup, as well as how ongoing university research is benefitting the startup, and vice versa.

**Biography:** Dr. Webster received his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University 2007, and then joined the faculty at Vanderbilt University. He directs the Medical Engineering and Discovery Laboratory, and co-founded the Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering, which brings together physicians and engineers to solve challenging clinical problems. He is a founder and President of Virtuoso Surgical, Inc. and EndoTheia, Inc. which are commercializing technologies invented in his laboratory. Prof. Webster's research interests include surgical robotics and image-guided surgery. He is a recipient of the IEEE Robotics and Automation Society Early Career Award, the National Science Foundation CAREER award, the Robotics Science and Systems Early Career Spotlight Award, IEEE Volz award, and the award for Excellence in Teaching from Vanderbilt University. He holds appointments in Electrical Engineering, Otolaryngology, Neurological Surgery, Urologic Surgery, and Medicine at Vanderbilt.

**Biography:** Dr. Herrell received his MD degree from the University of Virginia in 1990 and completed his urologic residency in 1996 also at UVA. He then completed one of the earliest fellowships in minimally invasive surgery including laparoscopy and endourology. He led the development of the surgical robotics program and minimally invasive fellowship at Vanderbilt and built an active clinical practice in advanced minimally invasive surgery including robotic surgery for prostate and kidney cancer and endourology. He serves as principal investigator on multiple NIH grants aiming at developing advanced robotic surgery platforms and tools. He is a co-founder and steering committee member of the Vanderbilt Institute for Surgery and Engineering (VISE), which fosters collaborations between engineers and physicians to solve unmet clinical challenges and encompasses over 20 engineering laboratories and more than 40 clinical collaborators. He served two terms on the American Urological Association Practice Guideline panel, including on the oversight committee and as Vice-Chair. He is a founder of two medical device startups that commercialize technology developed at Vanderbilt: Virtuoso Surgical, Inc. for which he currently serves as CEO, and EndoTheia Inc., for which he serves as Chief Medical Officer. He is often sought after as a lecturer on new medical devices and operating room technologies and techniques that hold promise to impact urologic and surgical practice. He holds appointments in Biomedical Engineering and Mechanical Engineering at Vanderbilt University.
