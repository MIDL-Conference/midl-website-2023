## Reporting violations and investigations

Anyone who is a target of, or who witnesses behavior in violation of this Code of Conduct may report the violation. MIDL will protect the confidentiality of reporters to the extent possible and will accept anonymous reports if the reporter does not want to identify themselves.

Alleged violations to this Code of Conduct should be reported in a timely fashion to the MIDL safety officers at [ombudsperson@midl.io](mailto:ombudsperson@midl.io). The safety officers will proceed to investigate as appropriate to the circumstances; however, they may refuse to respond to a complaint determined to be frivolous or vexatious. The decision of when to investigate is at the sole discretion of the safety officers.

The safety officers may recommend any such actions that will result in a fair and just conclusion of the situation, with the ultimate goal of ensuring that MIDL events provide a welcoming environment, free from threatening conduct, harassment, and intimidation.

## Process

Following the safety officers recommendation, the MIDL Board sub-committee on disciplinary affairs will review all information provided by the safety officers and issue its decision. Unacceptable behavior may cause removal from, or denial of access to, current or future MIDL events; suspension or termination of membership; revocation of any awards or other recognition from MIDL; and other actions, without refund of any applicable registration fees or costs. In addition, violations may be reported to the individual's employer.

If action is taken, an appeals process will be made available.
