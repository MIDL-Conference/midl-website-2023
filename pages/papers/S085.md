    <span class="abstract">
        The recent advent of foundation models and large language models has enabled scientists to leverage large-scale knowledge of pretrained (vision) transformers and efficiently tailor it to downstream tasks. This technology can potentially automate multiple aspects of cancer diagnosis in digital pathology, from whole-slide image classification to generating pathology reports while training with pairs of images and text from the diagnostic conclusion. In this work, we orchestrate a set of weakly-supervised transformer-based models with a first aim to address both whole-slide image classification and captioning, addressing the automatic generation of the conclusion of pathology reports in the form of image captions. We report our first results on a multicentric multilingual dataset of colon polyps and biopsies. We achieve high diagnostic accuracy with no supervision and cheap computational adaptation.
