    <span class="abstract">
        Accurate segmentation of perivascular space (PVS) is essential for its quantitative analysis and clinical applications. Various segmentation methods have been proposed, but semi-supervised learning methods have never been attempted. Here, a 3D multi-channel, multi-scale semi-supervised PVS segmentation (M2SS-PVS) network is proposed. The proposed network incorporated multi-scale image features in the encoder and applied a few strategies to mitigate class imbalance issue. The proposed M2SS-PVS network segmented PVS with the highest accuracy and high sensitivity among all the tested supervised and semi-supervised methods.
