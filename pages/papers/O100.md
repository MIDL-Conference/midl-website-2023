    <span class="abstract">
        Deep learning models benefit from training with a large dataset (labeled or unlabeled). Following this motivation, we present an approach to learn a deep learning model for the automatic segmentation of Organs at Risk (OARs) in cervical cancer radiation treatment from a large clinically available dataset of Computed Tomography (CT) scans containing data inhomogeneity, label noise, and missing annotations. We employ simple heuristics for automatic data cleaning to minimize data inhomogeneity and label noise. Further, we develop a semi-supervised learning approach utilizing a teacher-student setup, annotation imputation, and uncertainty-guided training to learn in presence of missing annotations. Our experimental results show that learning from a large dataset with our approach yields a significant improvement in the test performance despite missing annotations in the data. Further, the contours generated from the segmentation masks predicted by our model are found to be equally clinically acceptable as manually generated contours.
