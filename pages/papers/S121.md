        Non-uniform bias field due to external factors hampers quantitative MR image analysis. For reliable quantitative MR image analysis, appropriate correction for the bias field is necessary. In this study, we propose Hampel denoising diffusion model to effectively correct the bias field from MR images. Compared with N4 and Gaussian denoising diffusion models, the proposed model provided higher PSNRs, SSIMs and lower MSEs. Higher efficiency could be achieved compared to N4 when our model takes 9 times faster in inference time.
