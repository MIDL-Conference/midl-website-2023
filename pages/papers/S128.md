        Generative models have been very popular in generating real high-quality images. Diffusion probabilistic models in particular, have generated realistic natural images from textual input. However, they do not perform that well for medical data. Synthetic images may play a crucial role in privacy-preserving artificial intelligence and can also be used to augment small datasets. In this work, we propose using Large Language Language Models (LLMs) as prompt refiners for text-to-image latent diffusion models. We train the StableDiffusion model on the MedICaT dataset to generate medically correct images. Our results indicate that using an LLM to refine the prompts and input it to the latent diffusion model assists in generating accurate medical images.
