    <span class="abstract">
        White matter hyperintensities (WMH) are associated with an increased risk of stroke, cognitive decline, and dementia. A robust, yet accurate detection of WMH can help with the prevention of more lesions from forming. The task is still challenging as the lesions are often small and irregular. Hence, we propose a robust deep learning-based method for the automatic segmentation of WMH only using fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) scans and MRI-specific data augmentation and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. The methods are tested on public and private data, and we show that our model is more robust to domain shift and achieves higher segmentation accuracy than the alternatives.
