# MIDL 2023 Presenter Instructions

All oral presentations must be given onsite and in-person.
The default for poster presentations is also onsite and in-person.

## Oral Presentations

The oral session schedule can be found on the program page: [https://2023.midl.io/program.html](https://2023.midl.io/program.html)

Each oral presentation will be 12 minutes in length, with 3 minutes for questions.
Presenters are asked to submit slides beforehand in either Powerpoint or PDF formats.
Details about upload and day-of directions to the speaker ready room will be updated here,
and also sent via email.

We recommend authors use a 16:9 aspect ratio for slides.

## Poster Presentations

Maximum horizontal poster size is approximately 47 inches (119 cm).
While vertical space is limited to 47 inches as well,
we strongly recommend leaving a margin due to fastening/physical board size constraints.
Posters printed on A0 paper, oriented long edge horizontally, should fit
on each board, with a small margin.

Poster session assignments can be found on the program page:
[https://2023.midl.io/program.html](https://2023.midl.io/program.html)

Exact poster number assignments are forthcoming, but we anticipate 1 hour poster sessions,
during which at least one author should be present at the poster for the duration of
the session. Posters should remain up for the entire day.

## Virtual Poster Presentations

[Click here for the Virtual Poster Presentation Form](https://forms.gle/y62iqgJJTts5bmJt9).

The virtual poster presentation is open to two groups:  

1. **Mandatory for virtual poster presenters**: All authors of accepted posters who are
unable to attend MIDL in-person must register for the virtual poster presentation via
the above form. Each virtual presenter should submit a 3-5 minute pre-recorded video (.mp4 format)
and an e-poster (.pdf format).  
2. **Optional for oral and onsite poster presenters**: For all onsite oral and poster
presentations, the virtual presentation option is available, but not required. These
authors can still submit the above form to display a 3-5 minute pre-recorded video and a PDF poster
on the MIDL website, and join the Gather Town virtual poster session. However, all oral
and onsite poster presentations must also be presented in-person.  

Additional details can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wZYFcHv2Eb1-trcv598BTtZvP4_aImT9/view).

The virtual poster session will be hosted in Gather Town.
